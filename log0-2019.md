# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: First day starting The Odin Project, going through Web Development 101. Completed the Basics and Installation, played with the rails app! 

**Thoughts**: I've been interested in pursuing software full time for years but kept telling myself why disrupt my successful career to restart? Years later I'm asking the same question, so I stopped asking and I'm starting. I'm not really sure I want to dive into software full time but, I want to put in the effort to figure it out. At the end of the day, I'll walk away with new skills that will pair nicely with my current career regardless. I've learned I'm not restarting from zero but, from experience. I've really enjoyed how the curriculum is setup so far. Looking forward to this journey. 

### Day 3: August 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued going through Web Dev 101 of The Odin Project. Fginished the Git basics section, it was a nice refresher from my attempt to previously learn it. I think I’ll be finally updating my vlanChangeUtility in my other repo using Git going forward.

**Thoughts**: Git is super powerful. I already see the value, I initially thought it would be all delta changed base but sure enough its entire clones. 

### Day 4: August 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Web Dev 101, Front End section. Started the Codecademy course for HTML. 

**Thoughts**: Around 1-2 years ago I had previously completed the Codecademy HTML/CSS courses. I'm excited to go back through it again though, it's a great refresher. I've tried to build websites since I was 14, I used everything from photoshop slicing, Dreamweaver, ect but I never really finished one. I'm really looking forward to the project of building the google webpage.

### Day 5: August 13, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Continued and conquered Introduction to HTML! Moving on to the HTML Document standards section tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: A lot of this is familiar but going through this time it feels different. Not because I knew a lot of the information but because I'm watching additional videos, reading blogs posts, ect. I feel a much better grasp on the material.

### Day 11: August 19, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Finished today the Codecademy section on HTML Document Standards, onto Tables/Forms tomorrow! 

**Thoughts**: I just got back from vacation and my brain still isn't functioning but, I had enough time off. I wanted to dive right back into my learnings. I'm exhausted though, time to catch some sleep ;). 

### Day 13: August 21, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Codecademy Tables section and started the HTML forms section.  

**Thoughts**: Still way too tired from vacation... ZzZzZ going to be a slow week. 

### Day 14: August 22, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the HTML forms section, onto the last section of the Codecademy course! 

**Thoughts**: Onto the last section of form validation! Maybe I’ll come back later in the day and push through. I was actually surprised HTML was responsible for so many form related activities. I just assumed many of these aspects were handled by different components. 

### Day 15: August 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Wow, finished the HTML Codecademy intro course today. 

**Thoughts**: I'm extremely excited to have successfully completed the HTML Codecademy course today! There was so much to learn! I remember when I was trying to build my Instagram bot previously using Selenium, I didn't always understand how to give the browser proper instructions. Learning HTML really is fundamental for everything. I can't wait to see what the CSS course will teach me.

### Day 17: August 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Kicked off the CSS course, was able to complete the "intro" section. 

**Thoughts**: When I went through the first exercise and I saw that beautiful webpage made up of only a few lines of CSS code I couldn't belive it. CSS is really powerful! 

### Day 19: August 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Codecademy section for CSS Visual Rules and Intro to the Box Model.  

**Thoughts**: Learning CSS has been a wild ride so far. The box model is interesting and how its laid out. I thought of a first few fun projects today. I’m looking forward to diving into them after I finish off The Odin Project Web Dev 101.

### Day 20: August 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Codecademy "Changing the box model"

**Thoughts**: Didn't have too much time today but, spent an easy 15-20 mins churning out the box model section.

### Day 21: August 29, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Codecademy CSS course with display, colors, and typography.

**Thoughts**: I’ve learned tons but I’m ready to power through and finish this course. I really want to start on the project to apply this new knowledge. Learning for too long without applying it makes me feel a bit bored. 

### Day 23: August 31, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the Codecademy CSS course!  

**Thoughts**: All I can say is wow. The Codecademy HTML and CSS courses were extremely fun. My favorite part was seeing how little HTML/CSS goes into building such a beautiful website. 

### Day 25-27: September 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the "google-homepage" project!   

**Thoughts**: It's been a fun experience taking all the knowledge learned over the past few weeks and applying it! I finally got the footer bar perfect. I'm struggling with a few more components but all the foundational features are there. I know TOP said "don't be a perfectionist" but I can't help it. ;). In the end I decided to be happy with what I built and will be moving on the the JS section.

### Day 37: September 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Kicked off the JavaScript fundamentals and completed the numbers portion. 

**Thoughts**: Wow, it's been 10 days since I last logged into The Odin Project. I had a lot of personal items that sidetracked me, but I was very excited to log back in today. The arithmetic section overall was self-explanatory but there were a few interesting concepts. I’d be more eager to apply them in an upcoming assignment.

### Day 39: September 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Managed to complete JS fundamentals part one and get started on part two. 

**Thoughts**: A lot of this information is similar from my previous learnings with Python. I’d be more interested in applying this knowledge to an assignment. At times, I feel TOP has you go through too much information between assignments. However, I’m going to keep following and we’ll see! 

### Day 40: September 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started to go through Strings Methods in the JS fundamentals part two.

**Thoughts**: Short session today, the material was too dense for how tired I am. Little progress is better than no progress! 

### Day 41: September 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued going through fundamentals part two.

**Thoughts**: I’ve realized it’s taking me quite a while to get through the JS fundamentals. I believe it’s because I am taking too many notes while reading the material. I tried something new today, I abandoned my note taking for the time being. Rather than rewriting a lot of the article, I’m just going to bookmark it. My goal is to just focus on the material rather than task switching constantly. We’ll see how my retention keeps up. 😉 

### Day 42: September 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished JavaScript Fundamentals Part Two! 

**Thoughts**: Wow, that took me a long time for some reason. I found all the different conditions a bit tricky. I’ll probably need to watch a YouTube video to learn a bit more here. I’m excited that learning functions is next! After a few exercises, I feel I’m missing Python a bit. It seems much more intuitive compared to JS but, we’ll see as I progress. 

### Day 43: September 20, Friday – 5 DAY STREAK!

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Developer Tools 2.

**Thoughts**: Developer Tools 2 blew me away! Having access to such a utility must really make development much more enjoyable. I can’t wait to try some of these out. 

### Day 55: October 2nd, Wednesday (OVER HALF WAY TO 100 DAYS!) – 

**Today's Progress**: Finished all the readings for Fundamentals Part 3 and started on the practice functions.  

**Thoughts**: Eh, a bit disappointed I took such a long break here. However, as soon as I sat back down, I was eager to get moving again! I’m struggling a bit when the practice section. I might return to my old style of notes. The capitalize practice problem is interesting and currently giving me a run for my money. 

### Day 60: October 7th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Was able to complete all the practice functions!   

**Thoughts**: Just wow. I learned so much practicing those functions. Everything from syntax, better using the IDE, and how a function functions (pun intended). 

### Day 61: October 8th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started on the rock, paper, scissors project

**Thoughts**: I’ve been waiting for this part in TOP! I love converting my knowledge into a project. It’s not working quite yet but hopefully by weeks end!

### Day 62: October 9th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Was able to get R,P,S working! Ahhh it’s so cool. 

**Thoughts**: I still have to complete the “game” function to score points and assign a winner. But this has been so much fun. I learned a lot by using an array and random to service the computer player.

### Day 77: October 24th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the RPS game. Was able to develop a scoring system. 

**Thoughts**: Super disappointed my last coding day was 10+ days ago! Tried to make up for lost time but spending quite a few hours today trying to bring the game to completion. I got very close but, it the while loop to play continuous rounds until a winner is declared is broken :/ soon!

### Day 81: October 28th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the RPS game!  

**Thoughts**: This program was very challenging but rewarding. It was fun for the first time to use concepts such as arrays and while loops in JS.

### Day 95: November 11th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finish JavaScript Fundamental Part 4! 

**Thoughts**: It’s been a while since I wrote a log but, rest assure I’ve been coding almost every day. Finishing JS fundamentals part 4 was really rewarding. I struggled a lot with the practice programs. It wasn’t until the practice section I realized that I didn’t understand the concepts as well as I thought. I had to step backwards and redo all of JS fundamentals part 3 again. I felt much more confident and once I was able to grasp the concepts firmly then, I moved onto completing JS fundamentals 4 with ease. My 100 days is almost up here, and this log serves as a nice reminder of how far I’ve come. Excited for the next and last 5 days.
