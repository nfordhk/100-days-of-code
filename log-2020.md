# 100 Days Of Code 2020 - Log

### Day 1: Feb 3rd, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed Fundamentals Part 1.

**Thoughts:** After coming back from my break post holidays, I'm having an extremely hard time solving the part 5 problems. Instead of continuing to push through them I'm taking the time to review the material again. The next few days I'll review each part of the fundamentals (part 2, 3, 4, and 5). Hopefully by next week we're back on track. :)

### Day 2-3: Feb 5th, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed Fundamentals Part 2 and 3.

**Thoughts:** Nothing super exciting but, it was nice to refresh specific sections. I was reminded of a few concepts and behaviors. This week will probably be a bit boring, but I feel like it's necessary to get back on track.

### Day 11: Feb 13th, Thursday
Today's Progress: Reviewed Fundamentals Part 4 and started part 5. 

Thoughts: It was really helpful going through loops again. I picked up on some new knowledge that I think could be applied to the problems I was having with fundamentals part 5.
