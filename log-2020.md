# 100 Days Of Code 2020 - Log

### Day 1: Feb 3rd, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed Fundamentals Part 1.

**Thoughts:** After coming back from my break post holidays, I'm having an extremely hard time solving the part 5 problems. Instead of continuing to push through them I'm taking the time to review the material again. The next few days I'll review each part of the fundamentals (part 2, 3, 4, and 5). Hopefully by next week we're back on track. :)

### Day 2-3: Feb 5th, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed Fundamentals Part 2.

**Thoughts:** Nothing super exciting but, it was nice to refresh specific sections. This week will probably be a bit boring but I feel like it's necessary to get back on track.
