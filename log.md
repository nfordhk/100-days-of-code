**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: First day starting The Odin Project, going through Web Development 101. Completed the Basics and Installation, played with the rails app! 

**Thoughts**: I've been interested in pursuing software full time for years but kept telling myself why disrupt my successful career to restart? Years later I'm asking the same question, so I stopped asking and I'm starting. I'm not really sure I want to dive into software full time but, I want to put in the effort to figure it out. At the end of the day, I'll walk away with new skills that will pair nicely with my current career regardless. I've really enjoyed how the curriculum is setup so far. Looking forward to this journey.
