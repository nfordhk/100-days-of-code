# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: First day starting The Odin Project, going through Web Development 101. Completed the Basics and Installation, played with the rails app! 

**Thoughts**: I've been interested in pursuing software full time for years but kept telling myself why disrupt my successful career to restart? Years later I'm asking the same question, so I stopped asking and I'm starting. I'm not really sure I want to dive into software full time but, I want to put in the effort to figure it out. At the end of the day, I'll walk away with new skills that will pair nicely with my current career regardless. I've learned I'm not restarting from zero but, from experience. I've really enjoyed how the curriculum is setup so far. Looking forward to this journey. 

### Day 3: August 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued going through Web Dev 101 of The Odin Project. Fginished the Git basics section, it was a nice refresher from my attempt to previously learn it. I think I’ll be finally updating my vlanChangeUtility in my other repo using Git going forward.

**Thoughts**: Git is super powerful. I already see the value, I initially thought it would be all delta changed base but sure enough its entire clones. 

### Day 4: August 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Web Dev 101, Front End section. Started the Codecademy course for HTML. 

**Thoughts**: Around 1-2 years ago I had previously completed the Codecademy HTML/CSS courses. I'm excited to go back through it again though, it's a great refresher. I've tried to build websites since I was 14, I used everything from photoshop slicing, Dreamweaver, ect but I never really finished one. I'm really looking forward to the project of building the google webpage.

### Day 5: August 13, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Continued and conquered Introduction to HTML! Moving on to the HTML Document standards section tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: A lot of this is familiar but going through this time it feels different. Not because I knew a lot of the information but because I'm watching additional videos, reading blogs posts, ect. I feel a much better grasp on the material.

### Day 11: August 19, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Finished today the Codecademy section on HTML Document Standards, onto Tables/Forms tomorrow! 

**Thoughts**: I just got back from vacation and my brain still isn't functioning but, I had enough time off. I wanted to dive right back into my learnings. I'm exhausted though, time to catch some sleep ;). 

### Day 13: August 21, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Codecademy Tables section and started the HTML forms section.  

**Thoughts**: Still way too tired from vacation... ZzZzZ going to be a slow week. 

### Day 14: August 22, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the HTML forms section, onto the last section of the Codecademy course! 

**Thoughts**: Onto the last section of form validation! Maybe I’ll come back later in the day and push through. I was actually surprised HTML was responsible for so many form related activities. I just assumed many of these aspects were handled by different components. 

### Day 15: August 23, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Wow, finished the HTML Codecademy intro course today. 

**Thoughts**: I'm extremely excited to have successfully completed the HTML Codecademy course today! There was so much to learn! I remember when I was trying to build my Instagram bot previously using Selenium, I didn't always understand how to give the browser proper instructions. Learning HTML really is fundamental for everything. I can't wait to see what the CSS course will teach me.

### Day 17: August 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Kicked off the CSS course, was able to complete the "intro" section. 

**Thoughts**: When I went through the first exercise and I saw that beautiful webpage made up of only a few lines of CSS code I couldn't belive it. CSS is really powerful!
