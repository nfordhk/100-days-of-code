**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: First day starting The Odin Project, going through Web Development 101. Completed the Basics and Installation, played with the rails app! 

**Thoughts**: I've been interested in pursuing software full time for years but kept telling myself why disrupt my successful career to restart? Years later I'm asking the same question, so I stopped asking and I'm starting. I'm not really sure I want to dive into software full time but, I want to put in the effort to figure it out. At the end of the day, I'll walk away with new skills that will pair nicely with my current career regardless. I've learned I'm not restarting from zero but, from experience. I've really enjoyed how the curriculum is setup so far. Looking forward to this journey. 

### Day 2: August 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued going through Web Dev 101 of The Odin Project. Fginished the Git basics section, it was a nice refresher from my attempt to previously learn it. I think Iâ€™ll be finally updating my vlanChangeUtility in my other repo using Git going forward.

**Thoughts**: Git is super powerful. I already see the value, I initially thought it would be all delta changed base but sure enough its entire clones.
